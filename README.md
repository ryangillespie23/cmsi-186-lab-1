# CMSI 186 Lab 1 Movie Mixup Starter Code

This repository contains an incomplete, wrong, and very mixed up tree of movies and their genres and actors. It also contains some posers who actually aren’t in any movies.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and clean the data (and add new data) according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/1/).

Don’t forget to also update the README file in your new repository!
